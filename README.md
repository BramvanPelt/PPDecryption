ABSTRACT
This repository contains two projects, the PP-Decrypt library and the PP-Decrypt example package. 
The goal of these project is to give an example of how the decryption of encrypted identifiers takes 
place in an polymorphic pseudonym environment. 

ABOUT POLYMORPHIC PSEUDONYMISATION
Polymorphic pseudonymisation is an encryption technology developed by Eric Verheul to ensure the 
privacy and security of users in an authentication system. This technology has been incorporated 
in the Dutch "EID" system. Polymorphic pseudonymisation is based on the El-Ghamal encryption system
and split proof evidence. For more information on the El-Ghamal crypto system, please see: ... .

INSTALL
The library can be installed by compiling the code and adding the resulting JAR file to the JAVA_HOME build path.
The example can be runned from the commandline by copiling the code and executing the following command:
